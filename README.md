### Step 1: Introduction

Let's begin our adventure into the world of **code formatting**. Code formatting involves organizing and styling your code to enhance readability and maintain a consistent coding style throughout your projects. In this lab, we'll explore how to leverage the power of Visual Studio Code to automatically format Python code.

### Step 2: Enabling Formatting in Visual Studio Code

To begin, make sure you have Visual Studio Code open and the Python extension installed. If you don't have the extension, you can install it by following these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for "Python" in the Extensions marketplace.
4. Click on the "Python" extension by Microsoft and click "Install."

Once you have the Python extension installed, you can proceed to the next step.

### Step 3: Formatting Python Code

Visual Studio Code offers powerful built-in features for automatically formatting Python code. To format your code:

1. Open a Python file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Select the code you want to format or place your cursor anywhere within the file to format the entire document.
3. Press `Shift+Alt+F` on Windows/Linux or `Shift+Option+F` on macOS. Alternatively, you can right-click and select "Format Document" from the context menu.
4. Visual Studio Code will automatically format your code according to the default formatting settings.

### Step 4: Exploring Formatting Options

Visual Studio Code allows you to customize the code formatting settings according to your preferences. To explore and modify the formatting options:

1. Open a Python file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on "File" in the top menu, then go to "Preferences" and select "Settings" (or press `Ctrl+,`).
3. In the settings window, search for "Python Formatting" and click on "Edit in settings.json" or "Configure Default Formatter."
4. You can modify various settings, such as indentation, line length, spacing, and more. Save the settings when you're done.

### Step 5: Challenge

Now it's time for an exciting challenge! Open a Python file in Visual Studio Code and experiment with formatting different code snippets. Apply code formatting using the techniques we learned and observe how Visual Studio Code automatically adjusts the code according to the formatting settings.

### Step 6: Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the "Code Formatting Magic with Visual Studio" Guided Lab! You've discovered the enchanting powers of automatic code formatting using Visual Studio Code. By leveraging code formatting, you can enhance the

 readability and maintainability of your Python code, resulting in cleaner and more professional projects.

Remember to keep exploring and customizing your formatting settings in Visual Studio Code to align with your preferred coding style. Consistent and well-formatted code not only improves readability but also facilitates collaboration with other developers.
